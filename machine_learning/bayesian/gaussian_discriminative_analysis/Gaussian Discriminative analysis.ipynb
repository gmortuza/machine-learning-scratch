        "One of biggest advantages of GLA model is it doesn't have any hyperparameter. This model works really well if the input dataset follows the gaussian distribution. If all the class share the same covariance matrix then the model is called Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA) and if each class have different covariance matrix then the model called Quadratic Discriminant Analysis(QDA). \n",
        "Both the Logistic regression and GDA are classification algorithm and they share an interesting relationship. If we view the quantity of $ p(y=1 |x; \\phi_k, \\mu_k, \\Sigma_k) $ as a function of x we will get the logistic/sigmoid function. So, when would we prefer one model over another? \n",

        "Like PCA(Principal Component Analysis) this model can be used to reduce the dimensionality of the data as well. PCA finds the axes with maximum variance for the whole data set where LDA tries to find the axes for best class seperability. In practice, often a LDA is done followed by a PCA for dimensionality reduction.\n",
